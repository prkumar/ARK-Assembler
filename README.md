# ARK-Assembler

`ark` is an assembler for [ARK](https://github.com/prkumar/ARK-Processor), an instruction set architecture [we](##Authors) developed at UCSD for CSE 141L and 
designed to complete three specific problems. The `problems*.txt` contains the ARK instructions for these problems.

With a better understanding of ISA design tradeoffs now than when we were designing ARK (being that was back in early October '16), we consider it far from perfect and hope to make a few optimizations before completing the accompanying processor design.

## Usage

`ark/__main__.py` contains the assembler code. The assembler has three modes, determined by the number of positional arguments given.
 
 **NOTE:** The 'ark' directory is a python package, and the `__main__.py` expects to be executed from somewhere above that directory. I.e., the assembler will not work if you run it from within `ark`.

### Start a Read-eval-print loop (REPL)

When the assembler is run without arguments, it will start a REPL. In this mode, you  can "compile" ARK instructions to machine code, one instruction at a time.
  
```bash
$ python ark/__main__.py
Starting the ARK interpreter... (Enter CTR + C to exit) 
>>> shifto $accumulator
101010_000
>>>
``` 
  
### Read instructions from a file and print to standard out.

When the assembler is given a single argument, it reads instructions from the file at the given path and outputs the generated machine code directly to the screen.

```bash
$ python ark/__main__.py problem17.txt
Reading instructions from 'problem17.txt'...
Machine Code:
11000_1111 // high        0b1111
11001_1111 // low         0b1111
100011_011 // paste       $t1
11000_0011 // high        0b0011
11001_0101 // low         0b0101
1000000_00 // load        $s0
...
``` 

### Read instructions from a file and write to another file.

When the assembler is given two arguments, it reads instructions from the first file and writes the generated machine code
to the second.

```bash
$ python ark/__main__.py problem17.txt
Reading instructions from 'problem17.txt' ... Done!
Writing machine code output to 'problem17_out.txt' ... Done!
``` 

## Implementation

The assembler is built using David Beazleyâ€™s [lex and yacc implementation](https://github.com/dabeaz/ply).
